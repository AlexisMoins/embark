# Embark

An ambitious Vim theme.

## Getting Started

> At this time only terminals supporting truecolors will work. Make sure you have `set termguicolors` in your vimrc

First install plugin with your favorite plugin manager.
```
Plug 'skbolton/embark'
```

Then set your colorsheme in vim.
```
colorscheme embark
```

### Lightline support

A lightline theme is also available. Just set your colorscheme to embark.

```
let g:lightline = {
      \ 'colorscheme': 'embark',
      \ }
```
